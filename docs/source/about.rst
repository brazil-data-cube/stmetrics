The stmetrics, is a python package that provides the extraction of state-of-the-art time-series features. These features can be used for remote sensing time-series image classification and analysis. 

Produce reliable land use and land cover maps to support the deployment and operation of public policies is a necessity, especially when environmental management and economic development are considered. To increase the accuracy of these maps, satellite image time-series have been used, as they allow the understanding of land cover dynamics through the time.

This package is developed under the Brazil Data Cube project that is part of the “Environmental Monitoring of Brazilian Biomes project“, funded by the Amazon Fund through the financial collaboration of the Brazilian Development Bank (BNDES) and the Foundation for Science, Technology and Space Applications (FUNCATE) no. 17.2.0536.1. Brazil Data Cube is the successor of the research project e-sensing, funded by FAPESP (Fapesp 2014/08398-6).
